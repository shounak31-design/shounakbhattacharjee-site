      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        I work with behavioural science in places where decisions are difficult, information is incomplete, and the consequences matter.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Most of my experience sits in applied settings — crisis services, education, and research — where behaviour isn’t abstract and outcomes
          aren’t theoretical. I’m interested in how people make judgments under pressure, how institutions shape those decisions, and how persuasion
          and support can be designed responsibly rather than optimistically.
        </p>

      <h2>How I approach behavioural science</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I don’t see behaviour as something that can be easily “nudged” or optimised in isolation. People act within systems — legal, organisational,
          cultural — and those systems often constrain what is possible long before individual choice comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work focuses on decision-making under uncertainty, risk assessment and judgement, persuasion in high-stakes contexts, and translating
          psychological evidence into practice without losing nuance. I’m drawn to environments where there is no perfect option, only better or worse decisions.
        </p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>NHS crisis services and risk assessment</h3>
        <p>
          In crisis settings, decisions are made quickly, often with limited information. I’ve worked with structured behavioural and risk assessments,
          safeguarding considerations, and governance documentation, supporting decision-making where uncertainty, accountability, and human vulnerability intersect.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work sharpened my interest in how judgement operates under pressure, how language and framing affect outcomes, and how systems can either support
          or hinder good decision-making.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Behavioural interventions and educational support</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve designed and evaluated behavioural support programmes for young people with ASD, ADHD, and PMLD. This involved adapting evidence-based approaches
          to real contexts, working closely with families and educators, and producing outcome-focused reporting for commissioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, my focus was less on theory and more on implementation — what actually helps, what doesn’t translate, and how interventions need to change across contexts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Academic research and applied evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          As a research assistant, I worked on mixed-methods evaluation projects involving ethics approval, data governance, analysis, and stakeholder-facing reporting.
          I’m particularly interested in research that engages with complexity rather than trying to simplify it away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across academic and applied work, I’ve been drawn to questions of cultural adaptation, institutional influence, and the limits of one-size-fits-all psychological models.

      <h2>Current interests</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Decision-making under uncertainty</strong> — how people assess risk when outcomes are unclear.</li>
          <li><strong>Persuasion and influence</strong> — especially in institutional and high-stakes contexts.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioural science in public systems</strong> — where incentives, governance, and accountability shape behaviour.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-cultural and contextual adaptation</strong> — interventions that respect lived realities.</li>
          <li><strong>Writing and media</strong> — making these ideas accessible beyond academic or professional silos.</li>

      <h2>Work with me</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I’m open to applied research collaborations, behavioural science roles, and policy-adjacent projects — particularly where thoughtful analysis is valued over quick solutions.
